Tensorflow usded to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset

In this project, I classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects.  I preprocessed the images, then trained a convolutional neural network on all the samples.  Next, I normalized the images and one-hot encoded the labels.  Next, Iâ€™ve built a convolution, max pool, fully connected, input, and output layers. Then at the end, I generated predictions on the sample images.
